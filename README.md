# Wine Quality Predictor

## Project Summary

This project predicts wine quality categories (Low, Medium, High) from physicochemical properties using a Random Forest classifier. Using the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository containing 6,497 wine samples (1,599 red and 4,898 white), we analyze 11 chemical properties including alcohol content, acidity levels, and sulfur compounds to classify wine quality. The Random Forest model was chosen for its ability to capture non-linear relationships, provide interpretable feature importance rankings, and handle the class imbalance inherent in quality ratings. Our analysis identifies alcohol content, volatile acidity, and sulphates as the most influential factors in determining wine quality.

## Dependencies

To ensure reproducibility, this project uses **Conda** for environment management. The key dependencies are listed in `environment.yml`. Major libraries include:

* Python 3.11
* pandas 2.1
* numpy 1.26
* matplotlib 3.8
* seaborn 0.13
* scikit-learn 1.3
* Jupyter / JupyterLab 4.0

*Note: Lock files for different operating systems (macOS Intel, macOS ARM, Linux, Windows) are provided in `conda-lock.yml`.*

## How to Run the Analysis in Jupyter Lab

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the analysis:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/junliliu1/wine_quality_predictor.git
cd wine_quality_predictor
```

### Step 2: Environment Setup

Create the environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate wine_quality_predictor
```

### Step 3: Run the Analysis

The data files are already included in the `data/` directory.

1. Launch Jupyter Lab:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

2. Open the analysis file: `wine_quality_predictor_report.ipynb`

3. Run all cells (Kernel > Restart & Run All) to reproduce the analysis and generate the visualizations.

## Dependencies

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a container solution used to manage the software dependencies for this project. The Docker image used for this project is based on the condaforge/miniforge3:latest image. Additional dependencies are specified in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)

### Installing Docker

If you don't have Docker installed, download and install it from:
- **Windows/Mac**: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- **Linux**: Follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

To verify Docker is installed correctly, run:
```bash
docker --version
```

### Other Requirements
- Wine dataset (if not included in the container)

## Quick Start

## Running the Analysis

### Step 1: Clean the Project

Navigate to the root of this project on your computer using the command line and enter the following command to reset the project to a clean state (i.e., remove all files generated by previous runs of the analysis):

```bash
docker-compose run --rm analysis-env make clean
```

### Step 2: Run the Full Analysis

To run the analysis in its entirety, enter the following command in the terminal in the project root:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm analysis-env make all
```

## Clean Up

To shut down the container and clean up the resources, type `Ctrl` + `C` in the terminal where you launched the container, and then type:

```bash
docker compose rm
```

## Working with the Project in VS Code

If you prefer to work in VS Code, you can run the following from the root of the project in a terminal in VS Code to launch the container in the terminal there:

```bash
docker compose run --rm terminal bash
```

To exit the container, type `exit` in the terminal.

## Usage

Once the container is running, you can make predictions by providing wine characteristics as input. The model will return a quality prediction score.
